## About

__TO VIEW THE NEW AND UPDATED VERSION OF OUR PROJECT, PLEASE VIEW:__ https://github.com/Travis024/CSCI-3308-NEW-Project-Code/blob/master/README.md

Over the course of the semester we put our newly learned skills to use as we built a Boulder-based activity recommendation web application named LivBoulder.

Boulder, Colorado is a place with adventures and activities for everybody, but that doesnâ€™t mean that finding the perfect thing to do on a gorgeous Colorado day is easy! Making choices can often be rather difficult, and residents of Boulder end up spending more time on the internet looking up what to do than actually getting outside and enjoying mother nature!

LivBoulder, an online outdoor activity finding website, seeks to combat this exact problem. Shortly after signing up, users will be given the opportunity to fill out their preferences for outdoor activities including length of activity, difficulty of activity, season for activity, and more. Our website will then pull suggestions from a database that are personalized for users based on their preferences, thus eliminating the constant Googling required to find something to do elsewise.

## Organization

The "views" folder contains all HTML files used in the website.

The "resources" folder contains further folders for all images, CSS, and JavaScript files used within the website.

The "database" folder contains some database mockups, though this iteration of the website had no backend nor integration layer.

## Running the Website

To run this version of the website, simply dowload the files!
